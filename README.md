Hi! I'm Chris.

# Things I care about
## Paying-the-bills passions
* Infrastructure - I've recently spent a few years at GridCure and Rhythmos, making electric grids more reliable and helping utilities and fleets adapt to the mass adoption of EV's.
* Finance and democratizing access to credit - I spent 5 years as the VP of Decision Analytics at Ascentium Capital, ensuring we had a fair and efficient credit decision process. Time absolutely is money for small business owners, and same-day financing is a meaningful product for people all across the country.
